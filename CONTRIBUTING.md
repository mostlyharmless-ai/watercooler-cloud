# Contributing to watercooler-cloud

We’re excited that you’re interested in contributing! watercooler-cloud is the open reference implementation of the Watercooler protocol. Contributions that improve the protocol, developer experience, or documentation are welcome.

## Getting Started

1. **Set up Python** – we support Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12.
2. **Clone and install**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mostlyharmless-ai/watercooler-cloud.git
   cd watercooler-cloud
   python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```
3. **Run the test suite**:
   ```bash
   pytest -m "not http"
   ```
   (Add `-m http` to include integration tests that require the HTTP facade.)
4. **Optional tooling** – `pip install -e ".[dev]"` installs `mypy` for type checks. Run `mypy src/` before opening a PR when you touch type-heavy areas.

## Development Workflow

- Create a feature branch off `main`.
- Keep changes focused. Separate bug fixes, features, and documentation updates when possible.
- Run `pytest` (and `mypy` when relevant) before pushing.
- Open a pull request against `main` and fill out the PR template.
- Ensure all GitHub Actions checks pass. CI runs tests on Ubuntu and macOS across Python 3.10–3.12.

## Commit Sign-off (DCO)

We use the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) instead of a CLA. Every commit must include a `Signed-off-by` line:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>
```

Add it automatically with `git commit -s` or `git commit --signoff`. By signing off you certify compliance with the DCO.

## Code Style

- **Python** – follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) with type annotations in public interfaces. The repository targets standard library tooling; keep dependencies minimal.
- **Markdown/docs** – wrap at ~100 columns, use sentence case headings, prefer relative links.
- **Tests** – new features require tests. If you fix a bug, add a regression test.

## Filing Issues

- Use the **Bug report** template for defects and include reproduction steps.
- Use the **Feature request** template to propose enhancements or new adapters.
- If you’re unsure where to start, look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`.

## Communication

- GitHub Discussions: ask questions, propose designs, or request help.
- For security reports, follow the process in `SECURITY.md`.

## Code of Conduct

All contributors and maintainers are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please report unacceptable behavior to the contact listed there.

Thanks for helping make Watercooler better! 🎉
