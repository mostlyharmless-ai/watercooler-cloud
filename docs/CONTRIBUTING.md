---

## Coding Standards

### Python Style

We follow **PEP 8** with these tools:

```bash
# Format code
black src/ tests/

# Lint code
ruff check src/ tests/

# Type check
mypy src/
```

### Code Guidelines

#### 1. Type Hints

Always use type hints for function signatures:

```python
def say(
    topic: str,
    threads_dir: Path,
    agent: str,
    title: str,
    body: str,
    role: str = "implementer",
    entry_type: str = "Note"
) -> None:
    """Add an entry to a thread."""
    ...
```

#### 2. Docstrings

Use Google-style docstrings:

```python
def read_thread(topic: str, threads_dir: Path) -> str:
    """Read the content of a thread.

    Args:
        topic: The thread topic identifier
        threads_dir: Path to threads directory

    Returns:
        The full thread content as markdown

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If thread doesn't exist
    """
    ...
```

#### 3. Error Handling

- Use specific exception types
- Provide helpful error messages
- Include context in exceptions

```python
try:
    content = thread_path.read_text()
except FileNotFoundError:
    raise FileNotFoundError(
        f"Thread '{topic}' not found at {thread_path}"
    )
```

#### 4. Naming Conventions

- **Functions/methods**: `snake_case`
- **Classes**: `PascalCase`
- **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- **Private**: `_leading_underscore`

---

## Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=watercooler --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_commands.py

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_commands.py::test_say_command
```

### Writing Tests

#### Test Structure

```python
def test_feature_name():
    """Test description of what this validates."""
    # Arrange
    threads_dir = tmp_path / "threads"
    threads_dir.mkdir()

    # Act
    result = say("test-topic", threads_dir, ...)

    # Assert
    assert result is None
    thread_path = threads_dir / "test-topic.md"
    assert thread_path.exists()
```

#### Test Coverage Goals

- **Core functionality**: 90%+ coverage
- **Edge cases**: Test error conditions
- **Integration**: Test CLI commands end-to-end

#### Test Fixtures

Use pytest fixtures for common setup:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def temp_threads_dir(tmp_path: Path) -> Path:
    """Create temporary threads directory."""
    threads_dir = tmp_path / "threads"
    threads_dir.mkdir()
    return threads_dir
```

## Documentation

### Documentation Standards

- **Clear and concise** - Avoid jargon
- **Examples** - Show don't just tell
- **Up-to-date** - Update docs with code changes
- **Cross-references** - Link to related docs

### Documentation Types

#### 1. Code Documentation

- **Docstrings** - All public functions/classes
- **Type hints** - All function signatures
- **Comments** - For complex logic only

#### 2. User Documentation

Update these files as needed:
- `docs/QUICKSTART.md` - Getting started guide
- `docs/archive/integration.md` - Integration patterns
- `docs/mcp-server.md` - MCP tool reference
- `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Common issues

#### 3. API Documentation

- `docs/archive/integration.md#python-api-reference` - Python API reference
- Keep examples current
- Document all public APIs

### Documentation Workflow

1. **Make code changes**
2. **Update relevant docs** in the same PR
3. **Add examples** if introducing new features
4. **Update ROADMAP.md** if changing project status

---

## Branch Strategy

We use a three-branch model for development and deployment:

```
feature/* ──PR──► main (development) ──PR──► staging (release candidate) ──FF──► stable + tag
                                                                                    │
                                                                              v0.1.2, v0.2.0
```

### Branch Purposes

| Branch | Purpose | How Code Arrives | Testing |
|--------|---------|------------------|---------|
| `feature/*` | Work in progress | Direct push | PR CI |
| `main` | Integrated development | PR from feature branches | CI on merge |
| `staging` | Release candidate | PR from main | CI on merge |
| `stable` | Production releases | Fast-forward from staging | No tests (already validated) |

### What Each Branch Represents

- **`main`**: Latest development work. May have rough edges. Version is always `X.Y.Z-dev`.
- **`staging`**: Code being prepared for release. Version is `X.Y.Z` (no `-dev`). This is the **release candidate**.
- **`stable`**: Production-ready code that users install from. Always matches a tagged release.

### Which Branch Should Users Install From?

```bash
# Production (recommended) - always a tagged release
uvx --from "git+https://github.com/mostlyharmless-ai/watercooler-cloud@stable"

# Pinned version (check releases for available tags)
uvx --from "git+https://github.com/mostlyharmless-ai/watercooler-cloud@v0.1.2"

# Bleeding edge (developers only)
uvx --from "git+https://github.com/mostlyharmless-ai/watercooler-cloud@main"
```

### Branch Protection

| Branch | PR Required | Approvals | CI Must Pass | Push Access |
|--------|-------------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| `main` | Yes | 0 | Yes | Via PR only |
| `staging` | Yes | 0 | Yes | Via PR only |
| `stable` | No | - | No | Maintainers only (FF) |

**Why 0 approvals on main/staging:**
- For small teams, CI is the primary quality gate
- Requiring approvals can create bottlenecks
- Code review happens informally or async
- CI ensures nothing broken gets merged

**Why `stable` doesn't require PRs or CI:**
- Code is already reviewed and tested when it reaches staging
- The staging → stable transition is a fast-forward merge only
- Running tests again would be redundant
- This is a mechanical release step, not a review step
- The tag triggers the release workflow

---

## Versioning

### Single-Source Version

The version is defined in **one place only**: `pyproject.toml`

```toml
[project]
version = "0.1.3-dev"
```

The `__init__.py` reads this dynamically via `importlib.metadata`:

```python
from importlib.metadata import version
__version__ = version("watercooler-cloud")
```

**Never edit version anywhere else** - it's automatically derived from `pyproject.toml`.

### Version Lifecycle

```
v0.1.1 released on stable
         │
         ▼
main: "0.1.2-dev"     ← development happens here
         │
         │ (bump version for release PR)
         ▼
main: "0.1.2"         ← version bump commit
         │
         │ (PR: main → staging)
         ▼
staging: "0.1.2"      ← release candidate validated
         │
         │ (FF merge + tag)
         ▼
stable: "0.1.2"       ← released! (tag: v0.1.2)
         │
         │ (bump to next dev version)
         ▼
main: "0.1.3-dev"     ← ready for next cycle
```

### Semantic Versioning

We follow **SemVer** (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`):
- **MAJOR** - Breaking API changes
- **MINOR** - New features (backward compatible)
- **PATCH** - Bug fixes

Development versions use `-dev` suffix: `0.1.3-dev`

---

## Release Process

### Overview

The release process has **5 phases**:

1. **Development** - Features merged to main via PR
2. **Prepare** - Bump version, create release PR to staging
3. **Validate** - CI runs on staging PR, human review
4. **Release** - Fast-forward stable, create tag
5. **Post-release** - Bump main to next dev version

### Phase 1: Development (feature → main)

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-feature main

# Work, commit, push
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
git push origin feature/my-feature

# Create PR to main
gh pr create --base main --title "Add new feature"
```

**Requirements:**
- PR required
- CI must pass
- Code review (human or automated)

### Phase 2: Prepare Release (version bump)

When ready to release, bump the version on main:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Edit pyproject.toml: "0.1.2-dev" → "0.1.2"
# (Remove the -dev suffix)

git commit -m "chore(release): prepare v0.1.2"
git push origin main
```

### Phase 3: Create Release PR (main → staging)

```bash
# Create PR from main to staging
gh pr create --base staging --head main --title "Release v0.1.2"
```

**Requirements:**
- PR required
- CI must pass (this is the release validation)
- Human review: "Is this ready for production?"

After approval, merge the PR (via GitHub UI).

### Phase 4: Release to Production (staging → stable)

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout stable
git merge --ff-only origin/staging

# Create annotated tag
git tag -a v0.1.2 -m "Release v0.1.2 - Brief description"

# Push branch and tag
git push origin stable --tags
```

**What happens:**
- Tag push triggers release workflow
- GitHub Release page is created automatically
- No tests run (already validated on staging)

### Phase 5: Post-Release (bump dev version)

```bash
git checkout main

# Edit pyproject.toml: "0.1.2" → "0.1.3-dev"

git commit -m "chore: bump version to 0.1.3-dev"
git push origin main
```

## Post-Release
- [ ] Bump main to next dev version (X.Y.Z+1-dev)
- [ ] Commit: "chore: bump version to X.Y.Z+1-dev"
```

### Tags Explained

**What are tags?**
- Immutable pointers to specific commits
- Used for versioning releases
- Users install from tags for reproducibility

**Important: Tags must be created on `stable` branch only.**
The release workflow triggers on any `v*` tag push. Creating a tag from the wrong branch (e.g., `main` or a feature branch) will create a broken release.

**Tag naming:**
- `v0.1.2` - Production release
- `v0.1.2-rc1` - Release candidate (optional)
- `v0.1.2-beta` - Pre-release/beta

**Prerelease detection:**
The release workflow automatically marks tags containing `-` as prereleases:
- `v0.1.2` → full release
- `v0.1.2-beta` → prerelease

### Rollback Procedure

If a release has critical issues:

**Option 1: Release a patch (recommended)**
```bash
# Fix the bug on main, then follow normal release process
# This creates v0.1.3 which supersedes the broken v0.1.2
```

**Option 2: Delete bad release and re-release (minor issues)**
```bash
# Delete the GitHub release via web UI or:
gh release delete v0.1.2 --yes

# Delete the bad tag
git tag -d v0.1.2
git push origin --delete v0.1.2

# Fix the issue, then re-tag and re-release
```

**Option 3: Revert stable branch (emergency only, requires admin)**
```bash
# NOTE: Force-push is blocked by branch protection.
# An admin must temporarily disable protection, then re-enable after.

git checkout stable
git reset --hard v0.1.1
git push --force-with-lease origin stable  # Requires admin override
```

> **Warning**: Force-pushing to `stable` affects users with cached installations (they may need to clear uvx cache). Only use for critical security issues. Prefer releasing a patch version instead.
