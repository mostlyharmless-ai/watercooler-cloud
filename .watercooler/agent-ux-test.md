Title: Testing frictionless thread creation

This thread should be created automatically if it doesn't exist, with sensible defaults. The ball should flip naturally, and I shouldn't need to think about file paths or complex syntax.

Title: Even simpler workflow

Just tested: watercooler say <topic> --title '<title>' --body '<text>' creates thread if needed and adds entry in one command. Much better UX\!

Title: Added instructions resource to MCP server

Created watercooler://instructions resource that provides:
- Quick start guide (one-command workflow)
- Common workflows with examples  
- Ball pattern explanation
- Best practices for async collaboration
- Complete tool reference
- Pro tips

AI agents can now read comprehensive instructions at session start via MCP resources. This makes the collaboration pattern self-documenting and frictionless.
