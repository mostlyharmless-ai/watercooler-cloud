# Watercooler merge strategies for multi-user collaboration

# Thread files use union merge - preserves entries from both branches
# Safe because watercooler protocol enforces append-only entries
.watercooler/*.md merge=union
watercooler/*.md merge=union

# Index files use "ours" merge - regenerated after merge anyway
# Prevents conflicts on generated files
.watercooler/index.md merge=ours
watercooler/index.md merge=ours
