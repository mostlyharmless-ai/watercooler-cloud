# Security Policy

We take the security of Watercooler seriously. Please follow the process below when you believe you have found a vulnerability.

## Supported Versions

We aim to backport fixes to the latest minor release. During the 0.x series, we only patch the most recent tag.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Email: [security@watercoolerdev.com](mailto:security@watercoolerdev.com)
- GPG: optional—include a link to your public key if you prefer encrypted responses.

Please include:
- A detailed description of the issue.
- Steps to reproduce, including sample configuration if possible.
- The impact you believe the issue could have.

We ask that you **do not create public GitHub issues** for suspected vulnerabilities.

## Disclosure Timeline

1. We will acknowledge receipt within 3 business days.
2. We will work with you to reproduce the issue and determine severity.
3. Fixes will be prepared privately. We target a public release within 30 days for high-severity issues (longer if coordination with downstream users is required).
4. Once a fix is available, we will publish release notes and credit the reporter (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

## Scope

This policy covers the open-source `watercooler-cloud` codebase and official packages published by Mostly Harmless AI. Hosted services built on top of Watercooler may have additional policies documented separately.

Thank you for helping us keep Watercooler secure!
